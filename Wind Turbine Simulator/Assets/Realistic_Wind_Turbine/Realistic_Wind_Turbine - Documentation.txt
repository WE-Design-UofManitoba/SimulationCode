Load "Wind_Farm.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the required wind turbine from the Prefabs folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window. Note there are three different turbines, each with a slightly different start rotation and speed, to prevent all the turbines in a wind farm being exactly in sync.

Have fun!
